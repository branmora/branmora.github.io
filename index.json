We use an instrumental variables design to identify the causal relationship between participatory spaces and development outcomes. Using public trust as our instrument, we identify the causal impact of participatory spaces on development outcomes. Our results suggest that participatory spaces have had no impact in development outcomes during the 2008-2018 period.","tags":["Working Paper"],"title":"How participatory spaces impact development outcomes: Evidence from Peru","type":"publication"}]
