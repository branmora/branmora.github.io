Their budget on a given year depends on the previous year's performance. However, budget allocation within municipalities varies whether the municipality is above or below an arbitrary population threshold. I exploit this arbitrary threshold to study the impact of an increase in monetary incentives in fiscal policy using a regression discontinuity approach. The findings suggests that an increase in incentives increases expenditures but doesn't have effects in taxes collected by the Municipality.","tags":["Working Paper"],"title":"Fiscal incentive programs and Municipal Policy: A regression discontinuity approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brandon Mora"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f65cba65d50f1e51af91b17b6d3aa5b9","permalink":"https://branmora.github.io/publication/working-paper-1/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Participatory spaces are an integral form of public participation among the civil society and public institutions in Peru. These spaces fulfill the role of generating agreement in public policy's objetives between civil society and government, and within government's institutions themselves. In this paper we explore the degree to which participatory spaces have had an impact on development outcomes in Peru. We use an instrumental variables design, employing public trust in the Regional Government as our main instrument. Our results suggest that participatory spaces have had a limited impact in development outcomes during the 2008-2018 period.","tags":["Working Paper"],"title":"Public participation and local development: Evidence from Peru","type":"publication"}]
