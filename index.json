These spaces fulfill the role of generating agreement in public policy's objetives between civil society and government, and within government's institutions themselves. In this paper we explore the degree to which participatory spaces have had an impact on development outcomes in Peru. We use an instrumental variables design, employing public trust in the Regional Government as our main instrument. Our results suggest that participatory spaces have had a limited impact in development outcomes during the 2008-2018 period.","tags":["Working Paper"],"title":"Public participation and local development: Evidence from Peru","type":"publication"}]
